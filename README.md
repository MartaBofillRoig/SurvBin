# SurvBin Package

## Background

We propose a class of two-sample statistics for testing the equality of proportions and the equality of survival functions. We build our proposal on a weighted combination of a score test for the difference in proportions and a Weighted Kaplan-Meier statistic-based test for the difference of survival functions. The proposed statistics are fully non-parametric and do not rely on the proportional hazards assumption for the survival outcome. 

We implemented the proposed statistics in the R package SurvBin.

## Description

The **SurvBin** package contains four key functions: 

  - *lstats* to compute the standardized L-statistic  (with pooled/unpooled variance estimators);
  - *lstats_boots* to compute the standardized L-statistic (with bootstrap variance estimator);
  - *survtest* to compute the Weighted Kaplan-Meier based-test;
  - *bintest* to compute the proportions' test. 

The **SurvBin** package also provides the function *survbinCov* that can be used to calculate the covariance between the survival and binary statistics; and the function *simsurvbin* for simulating bivariate binary and survival data.
