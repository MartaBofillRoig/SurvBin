# SurvBin Package

The **SurvBin** package contains three key functions: 

  - *lstats* to compute the standardized L-statistic;
  - *survtest* to compute the Weighted Kaplan-Meier based-test;
  - *bintest* to compute the proportions' test. 

The **SurvBin** package also provides the function *survbinCov* that can be used to calculate the covariance between the survival and binary statistics; and the function *simsurvbin* for simulating bivariate binary and survival data.
